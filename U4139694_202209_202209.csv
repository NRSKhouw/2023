A reference to a ""trade date"" is a reference to the trade date in the place where the market for the relevant product is located. Ending settled cash reflects the cash which has actually settled. "
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Initial and maintenance margin requirements are available within the Account Window of the Trader Workstation.
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Quantities preceded by a "-" sign indicate sell transactions. Other transactions are purchases.

Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,Times are displayed in Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)/Australian Eastern Daylight Savings Time (AEDT); there will therefore be a difference between the times reported in this statement/report and the times that a trade is reported by the exchange to have occurred in markets which operate in a different time zone. This report covers the period which begins at 10am on a given day through to 10am on the day following the given day unless otherwise indicated. 
Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,"You are responsible for promptly checking this statement. You must immediately notify IBA if you become aware that there is an error in this statement. We are entitled to assume that the trades confirmed in this statement are correct unless you notify us of any error within 24 hours following IBA (or someone on its behalf) giving you this statement. If IBA confirms execution or cancellation in error and you delay reporting such error, IBA reserves the right to remove the Transaction from the account or require you to accept the Transaction, in IBA's absolute discretion. Please contact the Interactive Brokers Australia Customer Service Department through by lodging a ticket via account management or via the other means outlined on our website. You may also contact IB by phone, but if you report an error by phone, you should reconfirm such oral communication in writing."

Notes/Legal Notes,Data,Notes,"All VWAP trades are effected pursuant to an average price formula based on a reference price provided by a third-party data provider.
